# Tarot of the day
### Evolving Document v0.0.1

This feature will show the hippy nerds a random tarot card each day we the
related interpretation by Dana.

All of the demo cards are location in assets/images/ ... there is one real
tarot card to see how it'll be formatted.

* Platform: Wordpress with Woocommerce
* There will be up to 78 tarot cards per deck, but we'd like to have a super rare
giveaway or discount card (maybe one of each). We'll want to make it flexible in case this changes
in either direction count-wise in the future.
* The card background will remain the same for each deck (if we feature new
  desk in the future).

### MVP Features

- [ ] Random Tarot card or Rare card per day (24 hours). Would like to lock this
down to the unique visitor if possible, not the session.

- [ ] User clicks on the back of the card (the card on the left), revealing
the face card with description

* Tarot or rare card will have an accompanied description and possible actionable
buttons if it's a rare.

* The same card in theory could show up day to day, but I think it would be good
to keep it unique up to a week or so.


### Wish List Features

- [ ] Tie into the woocommerce account functionality so a user can save the
card on an admin page.

- [ ] The abilty for someone to embed the script on their blog or website with a link back to use.

I will be adding more to this as we go and should probably get it up on github
somewhere. If you think of anything that'd be cool along the way let me know.

Here are your extra points for calling me nerdboy, asshole!
